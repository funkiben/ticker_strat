    <h2 class="heading">Tickerstrat's Mission</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">In theory, Tickerstrat has the potential to be a powerful financial simulation tool.
        Tickerstrat will allow users to program with a versatile scripting language to queue up trades matching
        technical indicators in a simulated environment. This model allows for users to test technical based models and
        investing strategies in real time and with no risk. </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        This tool is meant to be used for purely educational purposes, Tickerstrat provides no investment advice.</p>
